(1) DevOps Basics
--------------------

Q1. What is DevOps?
👉 DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combine Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) to deliver software faster, more reliably, and continuously.

Q2. Why do we need DevOps?
👉 To bridge the gap between developers and operations, automate processes, and release software quickly with fewer bugs.

Q3. How is DevOps different from traditional software development?
👉 Traditional: Separate Dev & Ops teams → slow releases.
👉 DevOps: Collaboration + automation → faster, reliable releases.

Q4. Name some tools used in DevOps.
👉 Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, ELK Stack.


(2) Goals of DevOps
----------------------

Q1. What are the main goals of DevOps?
👉 Faster delivery, automation, better collaboration, CI/CD, high quality software, and quick recovery from failures.

Q2. How does DevOps improve collaboration?
